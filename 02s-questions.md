## Questions and Conditional Questions {#questions}

In the previous section I defended this principle:

Relevant Conditional Questions
:    If _S_ believes that $p$, then for any question _Q?_ that _S_ is currently taking an interest in, _S_ is disposed to answer the questions _Q?_ and _If p, Q?_ the same way.

To spell out what that principle amounts to, I need to say something about what questions are, and what conditional questions are. I'm going to say just enough about questions to understand the principle. This won't be anything like a full theory of questions. While much of what I say will draw on insights from theorists who have worked on questions in natural language, I'm not primarily interested in how questions are expressed in natural language. Rather, I'm interested in the contents of these questions. These contents are interesting because they can be the contents of mental states. For example, a cat can wonder where a mouse is hiding. There are deep and fascinating issues about how we can and do talk about the cat, and the cat's attitudes, but I'm more interested in the cat's relationship to the question _Where is the mouse hiding?_ than I am in our talk about the cat.^[A useful introduction to ways in which questions are relevant to philosophy of language is the Stanford Encyclopaedia article by @sep-questions. A canonical text on the role of questions is @Roberts2012; this paper was originally circulated in 1996 and has influenced a huge range of works, including this one.]

The simplest questions are true/false questions, like _Did the Boston Red Sox win the 2018 World Series?_. These won't play a huge role in what follows, but they are important to have on the table. I am going to assume that whenever someone considers a proposition, and they don't take its truth value to be settled, they are interested in the question of whether it is true.

Next, there are quantitative questions, where the answer is some number or sequence of numbers.^[I'm including here any question that could be answered with a number or sequence of numbers, even if that would not be the most usual, or the most helpful, way to answer them. So _Where is Fenway Park?_ is a quantitative question, because _42.3467° N, 71.097° W_ is an answer, even if _The corner of Jersey St and Van Ness St_ is a better answer.] One tricky thing about quantitative questions is that they may admit of imprecise answers, but need not.

If I ask "When does tonight's Red Sox game start?", an answer of "Seven" would usually be acceptable, even if the game actually starts at a few minutes after seven. That's because, I take it, the truth conditional content of the utterance "Seven" in this context is that tonight's Red Sox game starts at approximately seven, and I'm asking a question that admits of an approximate answer. I could have been asking a question where the only acceptable answer would be the time that the Red Sox game starts to the nearest minute, or even to the nearest second. And I could even have asked that question using those exact same words. (Though if I intended to ask the question about seconds, using these words would be extremely unlikely to result in communicative success.)

The main thing that matters for the purposes of this book is that the questions with different appropriate answers are different questions. Even if one would normally use the same words in English to express the questions, the fact that they have different acceptable answers shows that they are different questions.

And as noted above, what really matters for this book is the mental representation of the contents of questions. There could be two people who we could report as wondering when tonight's Red Sox game starts, but one of them will cease wondering if they find out that it starts around seven, and the other still wonders which minute near seven it will start at. These people are wondering about different questions.

The more precise a numerical question one is considering, the fewer things one can rationally take for granted in trying to answer it. So the version of IRT I defend implies that the more precise a numerical question one is considering, the fewer things one knows. Or, to put the same point another way, the less precise a numerical question one is considering, the less impact interest-relativity has on knowledge. This will matter when thinking about how the theory applies to various examples. If we have ascribe to a thinker an interest in an unrealistically precise question, we might draw implausible conclusions about what IRT says about them. But this isn't a consequence of IRT; it's a consequence of not getting clear about which question a thinker is considering.

Next, there are questions that ask to identify an individual or a class of individuals. A striking thing about these questions is that they often have so-called 'mention-some' readings. To understand what this means, compare these two little exchanges.

1. a. Who was in the Beatles?
   b. John Lennon was in the Beatles.
2. a. Where can I get good coffee in Melbourne?
   b. You can get good coffee at Market Lane.

There is something wrong with 1b as an answer to 1a. It's true that John Lennon was in the Beatles. But an ordinary use of 1a will be to ask for the names of everyone in the Beatles, not just one person in them. (There are exceptions, and it's a fascinating task to work out when they occur. But it's not my fascinating task.) On the other hand 2b is a perfectly good answer to 2a. (Or so I think, but my knowledge of Melbourne coffee is a little out of date.) It is definitely not necessary to properly answer 2a that one list every place in Melbourne where one can get good coffee. That could take some time. Moreover, 2b does not (on its most natural reading) imply that Market Lane is the only place in Melbourne to get good coffee.

An answer is a 'mention-some' answer when it does not imply exclusivity in this sense. And a question admits of mention-some answers when it is properly answered with a mention-some answer. Lots of questions asking for individuals will be mention-some questions in this sense, but not all of them will. And, again, it is important to understand what kind of question is being asked to think about whether it is satisfactorily answered by an answer that does not imply completeness or exhaustiveness.

Next, there are questions with infinitivals. In most dialects of English, it is rare to use these to simply ask questions.^[My hunch is that there is quite a bit of dialectical variation here, I would need to do much more empirical research to back this up.] But they can be the complements of any number of verbs. So here are some examples of what I mean by infinitival questions. 

- When to visit Venice?
- How to climb Ben Nevis?
- What to do?

Any of these, and any number of other questions with infinitivals, can complete sentences like

- A doesn't know ...
- B is wondering ...
- C wants D to tell him ...

Mixing and matching the sentence fragments from the last two lists produces nine different sentences. Some examples of these are

- C wants D to tell him how to climb Ben Nevis.
- A doesn't know what do do.
- B is wondering whether the visit Venice.

The philosophical work on these kinds of sentences has been almost exclusively focussed on just one of the nine sentences I just described: the one combining a knowledge verb with a 'how to' question. I suspect this is a mistake; what to say about 'know how' reports is going to have a lot in common with what to say about 'wondering when' reports. (Here I'm agreeing with @Stanley2011, though I'm about to disagree with him on a related point.)

There is a puzzle about why, in English, we cannot use these questions to complete sentences like

- E believes ...
- F suspects ...
- G wants H to guess ...

I'm going to set that puzzle aside, as interesting as it is, an just focus on the sentences we can produce in English.

I'm going to call these questions with infinitivals _practical questions_. One thing to note aboutis that they are are usually mention-some. When I am wondering what to buy, and I resolve this by choosing one particular carton of eggs, I don't thereby imply that there is anything defective about the other cartons. I just choose some eggs.

For related reasons, answering a practical question like this is distinct from answering any question, or questions, about the modal status of different actions. Imagine that in the grip of choice-phobia I am stuck staring at the cartons of eggs, unable to decide which one to buy because they are all just alike. In that situation I might know that there is no carton such that it is what I should buy, and also that there are many cartons such that I could (rationally, morally) buy any one of them. But there are so many, and they are so alike and I can't decide, so I don't know what to buy.

Resolving this indecision will not involve accepting any modal proposition like _I should buy this carton in particular_. It better not, because I really have no reason to accept any such proposition. Rather, it involves accepting a proposition like _I will buy this carton in particular_. And that I can accept by simply buying the eggs. But there were many answers I could equally well have accepted, since there were many other cartons I could buy.^[I'm here mildly disagreeing with Jason @Stanley2011[Ch. 5] when he says that these questions with infinitival complements can be paraphrased using modals. But only mildly since (a) we might think 'will' just is the modal that gets used in the paraphrase, as @Bhatt1999 suggests, and (b) the differences between _what to buy_ and _what may I buy_ are small enough that maybe we can describe the latter as a 'paraphrase' of the former.]

Practical questions are distinct from questions about modals or utilities. But there will usually be a correlation between their answers. Usually, if someone asks you when to visit Venice, and there is one time in particular such that visiting then maximises expected utility, that's what you should tell them. That's when they should visit, and that's what to say when they ask you when to vist. Relatedly, practical questions can come in conditional form. We can utter sentences like the following in English.

- J asks K what to do if his patient has hepatitis.

And there is one feature of these sentences that needs noting. I don't know what to do if one's patient has hepatitis, so let's just say that J tells K to do X. What that means is not that in any situation where the patient has hepatitis, do X. If the patient's symptoms are confusing, it might be best to run more tests before doing X. What it does mean is that if the fact that the patient has hepatitis is taken as given, then do X. As always, conditional questions should be understood as questions about what happens in scenarios where the condition in question is taken as given. And the constraint expressed by **Relevant Conditional Questions** is that whatever is known can be taken as given in just this sense.

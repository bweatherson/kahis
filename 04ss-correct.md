### Correctness {#lockecorrect}

I've talked about this one a bit in subsection \@ref(mecorrect), so I'll be brief here. Beliefs have correctness conditions. To believe $p$ when $p$ is false is to make a mistake. That might be an excusable mistake, or even a rational mistake, but it is a mistake. On the other hand, having an arbitrarily high credence in $p$ when $p$ turns out to be false is not a mistake. So having high credence in $p$ is not the same as believing $p$.

Matthew @Lee2017a argues that the versions of this argument by @RossSchroeder2014 and @FantlMcGrath2009 are incomplete because they don't provide a conclusive case for the premise that having a high credence in a falsehood is not a mistake. But this gap can be plugged. Imagine a scientist, call her Marie, who knows the correct theory of chance for a given situation. She knows that the chance of $p$ obtaining is 0.999. (If you think $t > 0.999$, just increase this number, and change the resulting dialogue accordingly.) And her credence in $p$ is 0.999, because her credences track what she knows about chances. She has the following exchange with an assistant.

> ASSISTANT: Will $p$ happen?    
> MARIE: Probably. It might not, but there is only a one in a thousand chance of that. So $p$ will probably happen.

To their surprise, $p$ does not happen. But Marie did not make any kind of mistake here. Indeed, her answer to assistant's question was exactly right. But if the Lockean theory of belief is right, and false beliefs are mistakes, then Marie did make a mistake. So the Lockean theory of belief is not right.

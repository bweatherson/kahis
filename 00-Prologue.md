# Prologue {#prologue}

What we know is sensitive to ever so many factors. The thesis of this book is that one of those factors is which questions we are interested in. 

To know something in the context of answering a question requires, among other things, that we can treat the thing known as a fixed starting point for that inquiry. But there is practically nothing that we can treat as a fixed point in any inquiry whatsoever. If the stakes are high enough, or cost of questioning low enough, it can be appropriate to question almost anything at all. If what we know is what can be treated as a fixed starting point in any inquiry whatsoever, then we know almost nothing. Since we do know a lot, this can't be right.

The solution is to say that what we know varies depending on what questions we are interested in, and so on what inquiries we are engaged in. If a proposition can't be treated as a fixed point for a particular inquiry, then it can't be known so long as we are engaged in that inquiry. But it can, at least possibly, be known at other times.

The story of investigations into knowledge over the last fifty years is the story of finding ever more things that knowledge is sensitive to. The thesis of this book is that human interests, in particular the interests of the would be knower, should be added to that list.

It helps to begin with a list of some of the things which we already know that knowledge is sensitive to. Much of this list, indeed much of the rest of this chapter, will be familiar to experts. But for most readers, it helps to locate the view of the book by placing it in the context of familiar theses about what knowledge is sensitive to. So I'm going to describe a mundane case of knowledge, then discuss various ways in which that knowledge could be lost if the world were different.

Our protagonist, Charlotte, is reading a book about the build up to World War One. In the base case, the book is Christopher Clark's _The Sleepwalkers_ [@Clark2012], though in some of the variants we'll discuss she reads a less impressive book. In it she reads the remarkable story of Henriette Calliaux, the second wife of anti-war French politician Joseph Calliaux. As you may already know, Henriette Calliaux shot and killed Gaston Calmette, the editor of _Le Figaro_, after _Le Figaro_ published a string of damaging articles about Joseph Calliaux. The murder took place on March 16, 1914, and the trial was that July. It ended on July 28 with her acquittal.

Charlotte reads all of this and believes it. And indeed it is true. And the book is reliable. Although Charlotte does believe what the book says about Henriette Calliaux, she is not credulous. She is an attentive enough, and skilled enough, reader of contemporary history to know when historians are likely to be going out on a limb, and when they are not being as clear as one might like in reflecting how equivocal the evidence is. But Clark is a good historian, and Charlotte is a good reader, and the beliefs she takes from the book are both true and supported by the underlying evidence.

Focus for now on this proposition

> Henriette Caillaux's trial for the murder of Gaston Calmette ended in her acquittal in late July 1914.

Call this proposition $p$. In this base case, Charlotte knows that $p$. But there are ever so many ways in which Charlotte could fail to have known it. The following three are particularly important .

> _Variant J_
> 
> Charlotte didn't finish the book. She only got as far as the start of Caillaux's trial, but lost interest in the machinations of the diplomats in the late stages of the July crisis. Still, she had a strong hunch that Caillaux would be acquitted, and on this basis, firmly believed that she would be.

> _Variant T_
> 
> Charlotte is in a world where things went just as in the actual world up to the trial, but then Caillaux was found guilty. Despite this, Charlotte reads a book that is word-for-word identical to Clark's book. That is, it falsely says that Caillaux was acquitted, before quickly moving back to talking about the war. Charlotte believes, falsely, that $p$.

> _Variant B_
> 
> Charlotte reads the book to the end, but she can't believe that Caillaux would be acquitted. The evidence was conclusive, she thought. She is torn because she also can't really believe a historian would get such a clear fact wrong. But she also can't believe anyone would be acquitted in such a trial. So she withholds judgment on the matter, not sure what actually happened in Caillaux's trial.

In all three of these variants, Charlotte does not know that $p$. I take these three kinds of cases to be good evidence that knowledge requires (respectively) justification, truth, and belief. In variant J, Charlotte lacks knowledge because her belief in $p$ is not justified; it is a mere hunch. In variant T, Charlotte lacks knowledge because her belief is not true; it is an honest mistake. In variant B, Charlotte lacks knowledge because she doesn't even believe $p$; she has the evidence, but does not accept it. 

In all three cases there are philosophers who argue that these conditions are not strictly necessary, but it would take us too far afield to debate these points. I will simply take for granted that cases like Variant J show justification (or some kind of well-groundedness) is necessary for knowledge, Variant T shows that truth is necessary for knowledge, and Variant B shows belief (or at least some kind of strong acceptance) is necessary for knowledge. (I will come back to some of the issues about belief in chapter \@ref(belief).)

For a short while in the mid-20th century, some philosophers thought these conditions were not merely necessary for knowledge, but jointly sufficient. To know that $p$ just is to have a justified, true belief that $p$. This became known, largely in retrospect, as the JTB theory of knowledge. It fell out of fashion dramatically after a short but decisive criticism was published by Edmund @Gettier1963. But Gettier's criticism was not original; he had independently rediscovered a point made by the 8th century philosopher Dharmottara [@Nagel2014]. Here is a version of the kind of case Dharmottara discovered.

> _Variant D_
> 
> Like in Variant J, Charlotte stops reading before the denouement. And she believes that Caillaux was acquitted. But she does not believe this on the basis of a hunch. Rather, she believes it because she read in another book that official France was so discombobulated in July 1914 that it didn't manage to convict a single murderer. This is false, but Charlotte used it to reason to the true conclusion that $p$.

In Variant D Charlotte does not know that $p$. She does not know it because reasoning that relies on a falsehood in just this way does not ground knowledge. So here is another thing that knowledge is sensitive to - whether the grounds for one's belief are true.

The variations from now on will not be as intuitively clear; whether Charlotte knows that $p$ will be matters of greater dispute than in these first four variants. But I think there is a good case to be made in each of them. The first case is a version of an example due to Gilbert @Harman1973 [143ff].

> _Variant H_
> 
> It is surprising that Charlotte has never heard of Henriette Caillaux, because in the world she inhabits, the story of Calliaux is infamous. She is as well known as other famous killers like Ned Kelly, Jack the Ripper, and Lee Harvey Oswald. Novels, plays and movies are frequently made about her killing of Calmette. But in all of these popular depictions, the ending is fictionalised. Every one of them ends with Caillaux's conviction and execution. This happened because the authorities were so embarrassed by her acquittal that they created a vast alternative reality in which Caillaux was convicted. Charlotte, by an amazing coincidence, is the only person to have not encountered this story. So when she reads a word-for-word duplicate of Clark's book, she doesn't realise it is controversial, and believes that $p$. Had she seen any of these books or plays, she would have assumed her book was making some mistake, since it is 'common knowledge' that Caillaux was convicted.

Intuitions may vary on this, but I don't think Charlotte knows that $p$ in Variant H. If that's right, then whether Charlotte knows that $p$ is sensitive not just to the evidence she has, but to the evidence that is all around her. If she's swimming in a sea of evidence against $p$, and by the sheerest luck has not run into it, that can block knowledge that $p$.

The previous example relied on the possibility of counter-evidence being everywhere. Possibly all that matters is that the counter-evidence is in just the right _somewhere_.

> _Variant S_
> 
> In this world, an over-zealous copy-editor makes a last minute change to the very first printing of Clark's text. Not able to believe that Caillaux was acquitted - the evidence was so conclusive - they change the word 'acquittal' to 'conviction' in the sentence describing the end of the trial. Happily, this error is quickly caught, and it is only the very first printing of the book that contains the mistake. Charlotte started reading the book after seeing it in a second-hand shop. The shop had two copies: one from the flawed first printing, and one from a later printing. Charlotte buys the later one because it is the first one she sees; had she entered the history section from the other direction, she would have bought the first printing, and come to believe that $p$ is false.

In this case, Charlotte doesn't know that $p$ is true. There is too much luck in her happening to buy the later printing rather than the earlier printing. The belief-forming method that she uses - buy an apparently authoritative history book and believe the plausible and well-supported things it says - goes wrong on just this question in a very nearby possible world. (That is, it goes wrong in the world where she picks up the other copy.) And that kind of luck is incompatible with knowledge.

The contemporary terminology for this is that a belief forming method only yields knowledge if it is _safe_. And a method is safe only if it doesn't go wrong in nearby, realistic, scenarios [@Williamson2000]. So whether one knows is sensitive to not just the evidence one has, but the evidence one could easily have had.

But safety in this sense is a tricky notion. In Variant K, Charlotte seemingly does know that $p$.

> _Variant K_
> 
> Charlotte detests reading books on paper, and only ever reads on her Kindle (an electronic book-reading device). Just like in Variant S, there was an error in the first printing of Clark's book. But the Kindle version never contained this error, and in any case, Kindle versions are updated frequently so even if it had, the error would have been quickly corrected. Charlotte reads the book on her Kindle, and comes to believe that $p$.

In Variant K, Charlotte does know that $p$. She believes $p$ on good evidence from a trustworthy source, and there is no realistic possibility where she goes wrong on this question by trusting this source. I'll return to the difference between Variants S and K in a little, but first I want to consider two more cases.

> _Variant C_
> 
> Charlotte reads Clark's book and believes $p$. But like in Variant B, she was sure that Caillaux would be convicted. And she still thinks it is absurd that someone would be acquitted given this evidence. But rather than responding to these conflicting pressures by withholding judgment, she responds by both believing that $p$ is true, and believing it is false. She is just inconsistent, like so many of us are in so many ways.

It seems to me that in this case, Charlotte does not know that $p$. The incoherence in her beliefs on this very point undermines her claim to knowledge. And at last we get to the case that motivates this book.

> _Variant I_
> 
> Charlotte reads the book, and believes that $p$. She is then offered a bet by a curiously benevolent deity. If she takes the bet, and $p$ is true, she wins a dinner at her favourite bistro, Le Temps des cerises. If she takes the bet, and $p$ is false, she is cast into The Bad Place for eternity. If she declines the bet, life goes on as normal. And now she's deciding what to do.

The main argument I'll defend in this book goes as follows.

1. Charlotte shouldn't take the bet because it's too risky.
2. If Charlotte knows that $p$, then she knows that taking the bet will have good consequences.
3. If Charlotte knows that taking the bet will have good consequences, then taking the bet is not too risky.
4. So, Charlotte doesn't know that $p$.

So being offered the bet, having her practical situation changed in this way, changes what Charlotte knows. When she read the book, she knew that $p$; now she doesn't. What she knows is sensitive to whether she is deliberating about questions like _Should I take this bet?_

The explanation for why her knowledge is interest-relative is that what she knows depends on what she can, rationally, take as a fixed starting point in inquiry. When inquiring about whether to take the bet, she can take as fixed that the terms of the bet include a nice dinner if $p$ is true and disaster if it is false, that Le Temps des cerises exists, that The Bad Place is bad, and so on. To be sure, she shouldn't be perfectly certain of any of these things, but if we had to account for all of our uncertainty in every one of our deliberations, we wouldn't be able to do anything. So she takes those things as fixed. But she cannot take as fixed that $p$ is true. The rational attitude to take towards $p$, in the context of this very inquiry, is that it is very very likely. And that's a different attitude to taking it as fixed and true. And that's why she can't know $p$, while doing this inquiry.

But there are other inquiries where she can, rationally, take quite a different attitude towards $p$. If someone asks her what was happening in France in July 1914, and she is weighing up how to answer, she can take it as given that $p$ is true. That doesn't settle whether $p$ should be part of her answer, since it might be insufficiently relevant. There were a lot of things happening in France in July 1914, like in every month in every country, and she has to decide what to leave in and what to leave out. But, at least in the normal case, she should make that decision while taking it as given that $p$ is true.

So in the context of some inquiries, Charlotte knows that $p$, and in the context of other inquiries, she does not. What she knows varies with her inquiries. That is, it varies with what questions she is interested in. Her knowledge is interest-relative; it is sensitive to her interests.

But the point of this little survey is that this is just one more thing that knowledge is sensitive to. Variants J, T, B, D, H, S and C all showed other ways in which Charlotte's knowledge was sensitive to details of her situation. The aim of this book is that we shouldn't stop with variants like those seven; knowledge is sensitive to more than they show.

This does not mean that the analysis of knowledge should include references to interests, or indeed to anything else that covers the other seven variants where Charlotte loses knowledge. Philosophers used to think that just like we can chemically analyse jadeite as NaAlSi$_2$O$_6$, we can break it down into sodium, aluminium, silicon and oxygen, we can analytically break knowledge down into its constituent parts. This is a much less popular view nowadays, largely due to the failure of attempts at analysis. But we don't have to think that there is any such analysis on offer to think that, for example, it is a necessary truth that whatever is known is true. Similarly, we don't have to think that there is any analysis of knowledge that makes reference to the interests of the knower in order to think that what one knows is sensitive to what one's interests are.

In listing a number of different cases in which Charlotte can lose knowledge of $p$, I do not mean to suggest that the explanation of why Charlotte loses knowledge is different in each case. there is no common explanation of multiple cases. Indeed, in many of these cases her loss of knowledge is explained in the same way. Linda @Zagzebski1994 argued, convincingly, that any theory of knowledge that gave distinct a explanation of cases like Variant T (where the belief is well-grounded, but false) from its explanation of the other cases would end up with insuperable difficulties.So there must be some overlap between the explanations of the cases.

And indeed, I won't treat Variant I as independent of the rest. There are close connections between what's going on in Variant C and what's going on in Variant I. Assume Charlotte holds on to her belief in $p$, and treats it as a fixed point in her reasoning. Then consider her attitudes to these three propositions.

1. $p$
2. If $p$, taking the bet has only good consequences.
3. Taking the bet is irrational, because it might have awfully bad consequences.

If she accepts all three of those claims, she is incoherent. And this incoherence, like in Variant C, undermines her claim to knowledge that $p$. If she rejects 1, then clearly she doesn't know $p$. If she rejects 2, she hasn't understood the bet she is facing. (And that might mean she keeps knowledge that $p$; I'll return to that kind of case later in the book.) If she rejects 3, then she's irrational. And if the only way to save the coherence of belief in $p$ is through being irrational elsewhere, that also defeats a claim to knowledge.

So I think the interest-relativity of belief is best thought of as a side-effect of the way in which knowledge is required to be coherent with the rest of one's mental states. It isn't some free-standing addition to the theory of knowledge. 

Coherence is a tricky notion though. We don't want to say that anyone who is incoherent about anything doesn't know anything. All of us have some incoherencies, so this would amount to wholesale scepticism. We have to be careful in saying which incoherencies undermine which claims to knowledge. It is just at this point that ultimately the interest-relativity really comes in. Whether a particular incoherence undermines knowledge that $p$ is a function of whether the would-be knower is interested in the subject matter of the incoherent states.

There is something special about the first three variants: Variants J, T and B. The three conditions on knowledge they reveal have a special explanatory role. If someone knows something, that is explained (at least in large part) by the thing's being true, and being believed, and this belief being justified. Whether they know the thing is sensitive to all sorts of other different factors, including their interests. But arguably none of those other factors explain why one has knowledge in the cases that one does.

The distinction I'm relying on here, that something can be counterfactually relevant to whether a state obtains without being part of the explanation of that state, is easier to understand in more mundane cases of explanation. It is, famously, hard to explain the origins of World War One. But without settling all the causal and explanatory issues about the war's origins, we can confidently make the following two claims.

C
:    Had a giant asteroid struck Sarajevo on June 27, 1914, the war would not have started when it did.

NE
:    It is no part of the explanation of the start of the war that no such giant asteriod struck Sarajevo on June 27, 1914.

The counterfactual claim C can easily be verified by thinking about the consequences of giant asteroid strikes. (See, for example, the extinction of the dinosaurs.) And the claim about explanation NE can be verified by thinking about how absurd the task of explanation would be if it were false. For every possible event that could have changed history, but didn't, we'd have to include its non-happening in our explanation of the war. The non-occurrence of every possible alien invasion, mass pandemic, or tulip mania that could have happened, and would have made a difference, would be part of our explanation. This seems absurd too.

So the origins of the war are sensitive to whether there was a giant asteroid strike, but the lack of a giant asteroid strike is no part of the explanation for why the war took place. I want to say the same thing about knowledge and interests. What one knows is always (in principle) sensitive to what one's interests are. But in cases where one knows, one's knowledge is rarely explained by what one's interests are.

It is often thought to be wildly implausible that interests should matter to knowledge in the way that I'm arguing. I think that some of what people are reacting to here is the implausibilty of thinking interests could explain knowledge. And that is, indeed, implausible. But sensitivity doesn't imply explanatoriness, and I'm only defending the sensitivity claim.

Most of the people who think that it is implausible that interests matter to knowledge are happy acknowledging the varieties of sensitivity that are revealed by Variants J, T, B, D, H, S and C. They just think this one new kind of sensitivity is a bridge too far. There are a number of challenges to this kind of positiion, but I'll end this introduction by discussing a little one of the most mundane. What adjective do you use to cover the factors that those seven variants (and others like them) suggest knowledge is sensitive to, while excluding factors like interests

One option is to call them the 'traditional' factors. Now since discussion of, say, safety only really became widespread in the 1990s, the tradition of including it in one's theory of knoweldge is quite a new one. But I don't mind calling new things traditional. I'm Australian, and we have great traditions like the Essendon-Collingwood traditional Anzac Day match, which also dates to the 1990s. But this terminology has a very short shelf-life. After all, we've been discussing the role of interests in epistemology since at least 2002 [@FantlMcGrath2002], so that's almost long enough to be traditional as well.

Another option is to say that they are the factors that are truth-connected, or truth-relevant. But there's no way to make sense of this notion in a way that gets at what is wanted. For one thing, it's really not obvious that coherence constraints (like we need for Variant C) are connected to truth. For another, all Variant I suggests is that we need a principle like the following in our theory of knowledge.

> Someone knows something only if their evidence is strong enough for them to rationally treat the thing as a fixed starting point in their inquiries.

On the face of it, that's truth-connected. It says knowledge requires strong evidence. Now, of course, it also says just how strong a requirement is depends on what their inquiries are. But what the critics want to say is not just that every factor that matters to knowledge is truth-relevant, but every aspect of every factor that matters is truth-relevant.

And this last claim is independently implausible. Think about the difference between Variant S and Variant K. (Similar cases are used, though to make slightly different points, in @Gendler2005.) If you think Charlotte knows that $p$ in Variant K, but not in Variant S, then you think that whether she knows that $p$ might depend on whether she prefers reading books on paper or on an electronic device. And that preference isn't truth-relevant or truth-connected. Or compare Variant H to a case that is just like it, except a while ago Charlotte emigrated to a country where no one ever talks about Henriette Caillaux. In the variant, Charlotte knows that $p$. So her knowledge of French history is sensitive to her emigration status. And that isn't truth-relevant or truth-connected.

If we think knowledge is sensitive in any way to the features of one's environment, then it will end up being sensitive to one's interests. (This point is not new; it is well made by Nilanjan Das.) The notion of 'environment' that matters to these constraints can't be given a narrowly physical definition. It can't be defined, for instance, as all places within some specific distance from me. My environment, in the relevant sense, consists of a network of towns and universities throughout the globe, and excludes any number of places a short drive away. But should I become more interested in nearby suburbs than far away colleges, my environment would change. Since what is in one's environment is interest-relative, then any theory that accounts for cases like Variants S or H by appeal to features of Charlotte's environment is an interest-relative theory. And most 'traditional', 'truth-connected' theories of knowledge do account for cases like Variants S and H in this way. 

Now this isn't the only way, or even the main way, that interests matter to knowledge. But it is useful to see how easy it is for factors like interests to become relevant to knowledge. And when we return later in the book to objections to my version of the interest-relative theory, it will be useful to bear in mind just how many weird and wonderful things knowledge is sensitive to.

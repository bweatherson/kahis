So that shows that IRT satisfies Single Premise Closure. The argument that it satisfies Multiple Premise Closure starts with the observation that Multiple Premise Closure more or less follows from Single Premise Closure plus a principle I'll call **And-Introduction Closure**.

And-Introduction Closure
:    If one knows some propositions, and one comptenently infers their conjunction from those propositions, while retaining one's knowledge of all those propositions, then one knows the conjunction.

A conclusion is entailed by some premises iff it is entailed by their conjunction.^[This is not an entirely uncontroversial logical assumption. If one rejected it, one could in principle replace a lot of what I say here about conjunctions with talk about fusions. But that would complicate matters a lot, and in particular it would require working out how decision theory works when the underlying logic is substructural. That is way beyond what I want to do in this book, and to be honest well beyond my capacities. So I'm just going to take it for granted that premises implicate just what their conjunction implicates.] So in principle, the only inferential rule one needs with multiple premises is And-Introduction Closure. In practice, people do not generally reason via conjunctions in this way. Someone who knows $A \vee B$, and who knows $\neg A$, does not first infer $(A \vee B) \wedge \neg A$, and then infers $B$ from that. They just infer $B$. But I think it's a harmless enough idealisation to model them as first inferring the conjunction whenever they use multiple premises. So I will assume that if I can show that IRT does not cause problems for And-Introduction Closure, and I've already argued that it does not cause problems for Single Premise Closure, then it does not cause problems for Multiple Premise Closure.

Here is the quick argument that IRT does not cause problems for And-Introduction Closure.

1. The key feature of IRT, the one that potentially causes problems for And-Introduction closure, is that one knows that $p$ only if one can take $p$ for granted in one's current inquiry.
2. If, in the course of an inquiry, one knows some premises, then one can take them for granted in that inquiry.
3. If one can take some premises for granted in an inquiry, then one can take their conjunction for granted in that inquiry.
4. So, there is no IRT-based reason that And-Introduction Closure fails.

Premise 1 is just a restatement of my version of IRT. And premise 3 should be uncontroversial. If one can take some premises for granted, then one (rationally) is ruling out possibilities where they are false. And to rule out possibilities where they are false just is to take their conjunction for granted. So those premises should be fairly uncontroversial. What is controversial is that the argument is valid, and, in particular, that premise 2 is correct.

The conclusion is not that Multiple Premise Closure holds. Maybe you think it fails for some independent reason, distinct from IRT. I don't think the other reasons that have been offered in the literature are compelling. (I'll return to this point in section \@ref(otherclosure).) But I am not building the failure of these reasons into IRT. So the main assumption behind the argument is that if adding the 'take for granted' clause to our theory of knowledge does not lead to closure violations, then nothing else in the theory does. And the argument for that is basically that there isn't much more to the theory. So I think the argument is valid.

But it might look like the argument must be wrong. After all, it is easy to cook up cases where it looks like IRT leads to a closure failure. Here is one such example. It is another version of the red-blue game. In this version, the red sentence is, once again, _Two plus two equals four_. And the blue sentence is a conjunction _A and B_, where both $A$ and $B$ express historical facts that the player has excellent, but not perfect, evidence for.^[If you want to make this more concrete, pick a random history book off the shelf and choose two claims that are both reasonably specific - so there could easily be a mistake about the details - and not something that was independently warranted.] Now the following four claims all seem true.

1. Unconditionally, the only rational play is Red-True.
2. Conditional on $A$, the only rational play is Red-True. Even given $A$, playing Blue-True requires betting that $B$ is true, and that's a pointless risk to run when playing Red-True only requires that two and two make four.
3. Conditional on $B$, the only rational play is Red-True. Even given $B$, playing Blue-True requires betting that $A$ is true, and that's a pointless risk to run when playing Red-True only requires that two and two make four.
4. Conditional on $A \wedge B$, Blue-True is rationally permissible, and arguably rationally mandatory, since it weakly dominates Red-True.

So conditionalising on either one of $A$ or $B$ doesn't change anything, but conditionalising on $A \wedge B$ does change how the player answers a question. So it looks like in this case the player might know $A$, know $B$, and for all I've said be fully aware that these two things entail $A \wedge B$, but not know $A \wedge B$. So what's happened? How is this not a counterexample to premise 2?

The key thing to note is that when the player is choosing what to do, the following things are all true about them.

* They can take $A$ for granted. That is, they are rationally permitted to take $A$ for granted in resolving their inquiry about what to do.
* Similarly, they can take $B$ for granted.
* But they cannot both take $A$ for granted and take $B$ for granted. If both those things are taken for granted, then they can rationally infer that Blue-True will have a maximal payout, and hence that it is a rational play. And they cannot infer that.

It is cases like this one that required the clarification that I made at the end of section \@ref(theoreticalknowledge). The player here cannot take both of $A$ and $B$ for granted. And so they don't know both those things. So this is not a case where they know $A$, know $B$, and don't know $A \wedge B$. Since they cannot take both $A$ and $B$ for granted, they do not know both of those things.

The picture I'm presenting here is similar to the picture Thomas @Kroedel2012 offers as a solution to the preface paradox.^[I assume here familiarity with the broad outlines of the preface paradox. If you aren't familiar with it, I introduce the paradox at the start of chapter \@ref(preface).] He argues that we can solve the preface paradox if we take justification to be a kind of permissibility, not a kind of obligation. And just as we can have individual permissions that don't combine into a collective permission, we can have individually justified beliefs that are such that we can't justifiably believe each of them. This isn't exactly how I'd put it. For one thing, I'm talking about knowledge not justification. For another, it's not that knowledge is a species of permission, as much as it behaves like permission in certain contexts, and those are just the contexts where counterexamples to And-Introduction Closure arise. But these are minor points of difference; I'm agreeing in large part with his picture.

And thinking of things the way Kroedel suggests helps say something positive about what is going on in this game. So far I've said something negative - the player does not know both that $A$ and that $B$. And that's enough to show that the case is not a counterexample to And-Introduction Closure. A counterexample would, after all, have to be a case where the player knows both $A$ and $B$. But saying what's not the case is not a helpful way to say what is the case. To say something more positive, it helps to think about other cases where permissions do not agglomerate. To that end, I'll talk through one case involving professional norms.

Professor Paresseux is, like most academics, in a situation where professional morality requires he do his fair share, but is fairly open about what tasks he does that will constitute doing his fair share. Right now he has two requests for work, R1 and R2, and while he is not obliged to do both, he is obliged to do at least one. So he may turn down R1, and he may turn down R2, but he may not turn down both. So as not to keep the reader in suspense, let's say up front that he is going to turn down both. Our question will be, what exactly does Professor Paresseux do that's wrong?

To make this a little more concrete, and a little more complicated, I want to add two features to the case. First, accepting R1 would be better than accepting R2. He is uniquely well placed to do R1, and it would create more work for others if he turns it down. (As, indeed, he will.) But the norms governing Professor Paresseux are not maximising norms, and he does not violate them if he accepts R2 and rejects R1. Second, Professor Paresseux first turns down R1, let's say in the morning, and then later that day, let's say after a hearty lunch, turns down R2. Given that, there are three models we can have for the case, all of which have some plausibility.

The first model says that he was wrong to turn down R1. Here's a little argument for that, using language that seems natural. He should have accepted one of the requests. And since he was well placed to perform R1, it's also true that if he did one of them, it should have been R1. So he should have accepted R1, and turning it down was the mistake. Oddly, it turns out to have been made true that he did the wrong thing in turning down R1 by his latter decision to turn down R2, but that's just an odd feature of the case.

The second model says that odd feature is intolerably odd. It says he was wrong to turn down R2. Here's a little argument for that. At lunchtime, he hadn't done anything wrong. True, he had turned down R1, but he had moral permission to do that. It was only after lunch that he made it the case that he violated a norm. So the violation must have been after lunch. And so the violation was in turning down R2.

A third model says that both of these arguments are inconclusive. What's really true is simply that Professor Paresseux should not have turned down both requests. Which one individually was wrong? That, says the third model, is indeterminate. One of them must be, since he could not permissibly turn down both. But there is no fact of the matter about which it is.

If I had to choose, I would say that the third is the most plausible model. The arguments for the first two models are not terrible - indeed I think both are plausible models - but the arguments are equally compelling, and incompatible. So I suspect neither is entirely right. The third model, which says both of them are partially right - there is something not quite ok about both refusals - seems to better fit the scenario. But what I more strongly think is that each of these models is more plausible than either of the following two.

The fourth model is that there is a strong kind of agglomeration failure. It is determinately true that Professor Paresseux acted permissibly it turning down R1, and it is determinately true that he acted permissibly in turning down R2, but overall he acted impermissibly. It's true that in the abstract Professor Paresseux could have turned down each one. But in the particular context he is in, where these are the options to fulfil his duty to do his share of the work, and he does neither, is not a context where he can (determinately) avail himself of both of these permissions.

The fifth model says that since he had to do his share and did not, and both refusals are ways of not doing his share, both of them are impermissible. This seems like overkill. It is much more intuitive that Professor Paresseux has done one wrong thing than that he has done two wrong things.

I hope I haven't traumatised too many readers with tales of people shirking professional responsibilities. Because having Professor Paresseux's example on the table helps us lay out the options for what to say about Player. Player plays the version of the Red-Blue game I just described, where the blue sentence is the conjunction of two plausible (and true) claims from a well regarded history book he just read, and the red sentence is that two plus two is four. Player looks at the rules, infers via his historical knowledge that playing Blue-True will have a maximal return, and so plays Blue-True. I think that this play is irrational, and if Player knew the conjunction it would be rational, so Player does not know the conjunction. But what do we say about Player's knowledge of each conjunct? It turns out that there are five somewhat natural options that correspond to the five models I offered about Professor Paresseux. I'll simply list them here.

1. Player knows the conjunct for which he has better evidence, and does not know the conjunct for which he has less good evidence. It was impermissible to take for granted the thing that was less well supported. This parallels the idea that Professor Paresseux did something wrong in turning down the request he was better placed to fulfil.
2. Player knows the conjunct that he first took for granted, and not the conjunct that he took for granted second. When he first took one of the conjuncts for granted, that was a permissible mental act, but given that he had done it, it was impermissible to take the second for granted. This parallels the idea that whichever request Professor Paresseux turns down second is the impermissible turn-down, because it's then he becomes in violation of his duty.
3. It is indeterminate which conjunct Player knows. He doesn't know both, because if he did then he could take both for granted, and he cannot take both for granted. Given both conjuncts, Blue-True is a rational play. So he must not know one, but there is no reason to say it is this one rather than that one, so it is indeterminate which he doesn't know. This parallels the indeterminacy solution to Professor Paresseux's puzzle.
4. Player does know both conjuncts, since knowledge requires permissible taking for granted, and each of his takings for granted are individually permissible. But he doesn't know the conjunction, and so And-Introduction Closure fails.
5. Player does not know either conjunct.

The fifth model seems like the least plausible. Somewhat unfortunately, it is also the model I defended (or at least committed to) in "Can We Do Without Pragmatic Encroachment". There I said knowledge requires that conditionalising on the known doesn't change any answers to interesting questions, and any question taken conditional on an interesting proposition is interesting. So each of the questions _What should I play given the first conjunct is true?_ and _What should I play given the second conjunct is true?_ are both interesting questions (in this technical sense of 'interesting'). And inquiring into the first question is incompatible with knowning the second conjunct, while inquiring into the second question is incompatible with knowing the first conjunct. This was a fun way out the problem, but it was also overkill. Player loses one bit of knowledge, not two, so I don't think this is right.

Which of the other four models is correct? I think the fourth, which violates And-Introduction Closure, is the least plausible. That's largely because it violates And-Introduction Closure. But the other three are all plausible, and are all consistent with And-Introduction Closure. (And note that all five are consistent with IRT. IRT itself says very little about this puzzle.) My preferred version of IRT says that the common case is the third - usually in cases like this it is indeterminate what is known.

There are mix-and-match options available. Perhaps if Player's evidence for the first conjunct is (much) stronger than their evidence for the second conjunct, and it was the first one that they took for granted in reasoning, then they (determinately) know the first but not the second conjunct. I don't need to take a stance on whether cases like this ever arise to defend And-Introduction Closure. That's because all I need is that for any case like this, one of the first three models is right. And that can be true even if it is different models in different cases.

## Summary {#closuresummary}

Putting all that together, IRT is consistent with Single Premise Closure and with And-Introduction Closure. Assuming that it is a harmless idealisation to treat anyone who uses multiple premises in reasoning as reasoning from the truth of all of their premises, it follows that IRT is consistent with Multiple Premise Closure.

But this isn't quite the end of the story. Even if the arguments of the last two sections work, what they show is that there must be some way to explain away any apparent conflict between IRT and closure principles. The arguments do not, on their own, tell us what that explanation will look like. And without such an explanation, we might be sceptical of the arguments of this chapter, and indeed of IRT itself. So I'll come back several times to issues about closure. In chapter \@ref(ties), I'll go over what IRT says about cases like Zweber's, and Anderson and Hawthorne's, more thoroughly. And in chapter \@ref(preface), I'll say more about why I think IRT should be made consistent with Multiple Premise Closure, say how IRT handles some other recent objections to Multiple Premise Closure, and defend IRT against the objection that the form of closure it offers is too weak.

Before I get to that though, it is time to say more about a notion that has done a lot of work so far but which has not been adequately investigated: evidence.

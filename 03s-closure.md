## Knowledge and Closure

Here are two very plausible principles about knowledge, both due to John Hawthorne.

Single Premise Closure
:    If one knows $p$ and competently deduces $q$ from $p$, thereby coming to believe $q$, while retaining one’s knowledge that $p$, one comes to know that $q$. [@Hawthorne2005, 43]

Multiple Premise Closure
:    If one knows some premises and competently deduces $q$ from those premises, thereby coming to believe $q$, while retaining one’s knowledge of those premises throughout, one comes to know that $q$. [@Hawthorne2005, 43]

Hawthorne endorses the first of these, but has reservations about the second for reasons related to the preface paradox. I'm similarly going to endorse the first and have reservations about the second. But my reasons don't have anything to do with the preface paradox. For reasons I'll discuss in more depth in chapter \@ref(preface), I think concerns about the preface paradox are over-rated. So I will also defend Multiple Premise Closure, though subject to one idealisation I will get to in section \@ref(andintro).

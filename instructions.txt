Instructions for getting from Ulysses to Rmd

- In Ulysses, make sure things are commented. So write ~ around things you need to go over smoothly
- Select all pages in left hand column
- Select 'export preview' in the left end of the top right icons
- Save it as a markdown file in kahis-ulysses-bookdown as latest-export.md
- Rename it to a Rmd (Not needed any more - _bookdown.yml looks for latest-export.md)
- Build book!

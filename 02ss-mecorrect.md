### Correctness {#mecorrect}

@RossSchroeder2014 note that my earlier theory doesn't have a good story about why false beliefs are incorrect.^[@FantlMcGrath2009 make a similar argument, targetted at Lockean theories of belief more than at my theory. I'll come back to how this is a problem for Lockean theories in subsection \@ref(lockecorrect).] I think that's right. Even if $p$ is false, there is nothing necessarily mistaken about either having credence in $p$ above 0.5, or in having unconditional preferences match preferences conditional on $p$.

But surely false beliefs are, in a way, incorrect. They may be rational, they may be well-supported, and so on, but still if you believe that $p$, and $p$ turns out not to be the case, you got it wrong. There are other mental states that have truth as a correctness condition. Guesses are correct or incorrect, even if there need be nothing at all irrational about making a false guess. Indeed, any mortal who doesn't make false guesses from time to time isn't playing the guessing game well. But not all mental states are like this. If I hope that $p$, and $p$ doesn't come to pass, that doesn't make my hope incorrect. It just makes it frustrated. So to say that a false belief is incorrect is not to just make the trivial point that it is false. It is also to say that the belief failed to meet one important standard of evaluation for beliefs - correctly representing the world.

The new theory does not have this problem. Doing dominance reasoning where all of the situations one considers are non-actual is a mistake. It's not a mistake because it will inevitably lead to an irrational decision. But it's a mistake because one draws a conclusion that is not supported by the premises it is based on. Those premises only say that one option is better than another conditional on one or other condition obtaining. And that's a bad reason to say the first option is simply better if there is some extra option that might obtain. And whatever does obtain, might obtain.

This way of explaining the incorrectness of false belief suggests a central role for knowledge in norms of beliefs. False beliefs are mistaken because they lead one to treat the actual situation as one that could not obtain, yet the actual situation might obtain. But one can make the same mistake by treating a situation that doesn't obtain, but might, as one that could not obtain. And believing something one doesn't know will (typically) lead to doing that.

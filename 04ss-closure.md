### Closure and the Lockean Theory {#closure}

The Lockean theory makes an implausible prediction about conjunction.^[This subsection draws on material from my -@Weatherson2014.] It says that someone can believe two conjuncts, yet actively refuse to believe the conjunction. Here is how Stalnaker puts the point.

> Reasoning in this way from accepted premises to their deductive consequences ($P$, also $Q$, therefore $R$) does seem perfectly straightforward. Someone may object to one of the premises, or to the validity of the argument, but one could not intelligibly agree that the premises are each acceptable and the argument valid, while objecting to the acceptability of the conclusion. [@Stalnaker1984 92]

If believing that $p$ just means having a credence in $p$ above the threshold, then this will happen. Indeed, given some very weak assumptions about the world, it implies that there are plenty of quadruples $\langle S, A, B, A \wedge B \rangle$ such that

* $S$ is a rational agent.
* $A, B$ and $A \wedge B$ are propositions.
* $S$ believes $A$ and believes $B$.
* $S$ does not believe $A \wedge B$.
* $S$ knows that she has all these states, and consciously reflectively
endorses them.

Now one might think, indeed I do think, that such quadruples do not exist at all. But set that objection aside. If the Lockean is correct, these quadruples should be everywhere. That's because for any $t \in (0, 1)$ you care to pick, quadruples of the form $\langle S, C, D, C \wedge D \rangle$ are very very common.

* $S$ is a rational agent. 
* $C, D$ and $C \wedge D$ are propositions. 
* $S$'s credence in $C$ is greater than $t$, and her credence in $D$ is greater than $t$.
* $S$'s credence in $C \wedge D$ is less than $t$.
* $S$ knows that she has all these states, and reflectively endorses them.

The best arguments for the existence of quadruples $\langle S, A, B, A \wedge B \rangle$ are non-constructive existence proofs. David @Christensen2005 for instance, argues from the existence of the preface paradox to the existence of these quadruples. I will come back to that argument in chapter \@ref(preface). But what I want to stress here is that even if these existence proofs work, they don't really prove what the Lockean needs. They don't show that quadruples satisfying the constraints we associated with $\langle S, A, B, A \wedge B \rangle$ are just as common as quadruples satisfying the constraints we associated with $\langle S, C, D, C \wedge D \rangle$, for any $t$. But if the Lockean were correct, they should be exactly as common.

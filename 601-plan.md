Philosophy 601 - Winter 2020 - Brian Weatherson

Title: Knowledge and Interests

We will look at the debate about whether knowledge is interest-relative. Topics to be covered include

* The relationship between knowledge and rational action.
* The relationship between credence and belief.
*  The relationship between knowledge and evidence.
*  The status of closure principles for knowledge.
*  What kinds of things rational choosers try to maximise.
*  And, time permitting, the role of practical considerations in historically significant anti-sceptical epistemologies.

Much of the course will be structured around my book in progress on these topics, a draft of which will be available to all participants in the course.

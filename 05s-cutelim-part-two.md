## Basic Knowledge and Non-Inferential Knowledge {#basic}

It would be natural to conclude from the examples I've discussed that evidence is something like non-inferential knowledge. This is very similar to a view defended by Patrick @Maher1996. And it is, I will argue, close to the right view. But it can't be exactly right, for reasons Alexander @Bird2004 brings out.

I will argue that evidence is not non-inferential knowledge, but rather basic knowledge. The primary difference between these two notions is that _being non-inferential_ is a diachronic notion, it depends on the causal source of the knowledge, while being basic is a synchronic notion, it depends on how the knowledge is currently supported. In general, non-inferential knowledge will be basic knowledge, and basic knowledge will be non-inferential. But the two notions can come apart, and when they do, the evidence is what is basic, not what is non-inferential.

The following kind of case is central to Bird's objection to the idea that evidence is non-inferential knowledge. Assume that our inquirer sees that $A$ and rationally infers $B$. On the view that evidence is non-inferential knowledge, $A$ is evidence but $B$ is not. Now imagine that at some much later time, the inquirer remembers $B$, but has forgotten that it is based on $A$. This isn't necessarily irrational. As @Harman1986 stresses, an obligation to remember our evidence is wildly unrealistic. The inquirer learns $C$, and infers $B \wedge C$. This seems perfectly rational. But why is it rational?

If evidence is non-inferential knowledge, then this is a mystery. Since $B$ was inferred, that can't be the evidence that justifies $B \wedge C$. So the only other option is that the evidence is the, now forgotten, $A$. It is puzzling how something that is forgotten can now justify. But a bigger problem is that if $A$ is the inquirer's evidence, then they should also be able to infer $A \wedge C$. But this would be an irrational inference.

So I agree with Bird that we can't identify evidence with non-inferential knowledge, if by that we mean knowledge that was not originally gained through inference. (And what else could it mean?) But a very similar theory of evidence can work. The thing about evidence is that it can play a distinctive role in reasoning, it provides a distinctive kind of reason. In particular, it provides basic reasons.

Evidence stops regresses. That's why we can say that our fundamental starting points are self-evident. Now there is obviously a controversy about what things are self-evident. I don't find it particularly likely that claims about the moral rights we were endowed with by our Creator are self-evident. But I do think it is true that a lot of things are self-evident. (Even including, perhaps, that we have moral rights.) And we should take this notion of self-evidence seriously. Our evidence is that knowledge which provides basic reasons.

What is it for a reason to be basic? It isn't that it was not originally inferred. Something that was once inferred from long forgotten premises may now be a basic reason. Rather, it is something that needs no further reason given as support. (Its support is itself, since it is self-evident.) What makes a reason need further support? I'm an interest-relative epistemologist, so I think this will be a function of the agent's interests. For example, I think facts reported in a reliable history book are pieces of basic evidence when we are thinking about history, but not when we are thinking about the reliability of that book. But this kind of interest-relativity is essential to the story. What is essential is that evidence provides a reason that does not in turn require more justification.

This picture suggests an odd result about cases of forgotten evidence. There is a much discussed puzzle about forgotten evidence that was set in motion by Gilbert @Harman1986. He argued that if someone irrationally believes $p$ in the basis of some evidence, then later forgets the evidence but retains the belief, the belief may now be rational. It would not be rational if they remembered both the evidence, and that it was the evidence for $p$. But, and this is what I want to take away from the case, there is no obligation on thinkers to keep track of why they believe each of the things they do. There is a large literature now on this case; Sinan @Dogramaci2015 both provides a useful guide to the debate and moves it forward by considering what we might aim to achieve by offering one or other evaluation of the believer in this case. The view I'm offering here is, as far as I can tell, completely neutral on this case. But it has something striking to say about a similar case.

In this case the inquirer, call him Jaidyn, believes $p$ for the excellent reason that he read it in a book from a reliable historian _H_. Six months later, he has forgotten that that's where he learned that $p$, though he still believes that $p$. In a discussion about historians, a friend of Jaidyn's says that _H_ is really unreliable. Jaidyn is a bit shocked, and literally can't believe it. And this is for the best since _H_ is in fact reliable, and his friend is suffering from a case of mistaken identity. But he is moved enough by the testimony to not believe that _H_ is reliable, and so he forms a disposition to not believe anything _H_ says without corroboration. Since he doesn't know that he believes $p$ because _H_ says so, he doesn't do anything about this belief. What should we say about Jaidyn's belief that $p$?

Here's what I want to say. I don't claim this is particularly intuitive, but I'm not sure there is anything particularly intuitive; it's best to just see what a theory says about the case. My theory says that Jaidyn still knows that $p$. This knowledge was once based on _H_'s testimony, but it is no longer based on that. Indeed, it is no longer based on anything. Presumably, if Jaidyn is rational, the knowledge will be sensitive to the absence of counter-evidence, or to incoherence with the rest of his world-view. But these are checks and balances in Jaidyn's doxastic system, they aren't the basis of the belief. Since the belief is knowledge, and is a basic reason for Jaidyn, it is part of his evidence.

Note three things about that last conclusion. First, this is a case where a piece of inferential knowledge can be in someone's evidence. By (reasonably) forgetting the source of the knowledge, it converts to being evidence. Second, almost any knowledge could make this jump. Whenever someone has no obligation to remember the source or basis of some knowledge, they can reasonably forget the source, and the basis, and the knowledge will become basic. And then it is evidence. The picture I'm working with is that pieces of knowledge can easily move in and out of one's evidence set; sometimes all it takes is forgetting where the knowledge came from. But third, if Jaidyn had done better epistemically, and remembered the source, he would no longer know that $p$.

It is somewhat surprising that knowledge can be dependent on forgetting. Jaidyn knows that $p$, but if he'd done better at remembering why he believes $p$, he wouldn't know it. Still, the knowledge isn't grounded in forgetting. It's originally grounded in testimony from an actually reliable source, and Jaidyn did as good a job as he needed to in checking the reliability of the source before accepting the testimony. Now since Jaidyn is finite, he doesn't have any obligation to remember everything. And it seems odd to demand that Jaidyn adjust his beliefs on the basis of where they are from if he isn't even required to track where they are from. It would be very odd to say that Jaidyn's evidence now includes neither $p$ (if it is undermined by his friend's testimony), nor the fact that someone said that $p$. That suggests any $p$-related inferences Jaidyn makes are totally unsupported by his evidence, which doesn't seem right.

So the picture of evidence as basic knowledge, combined with a plausible theory of when forgetting is permissible, suggests that the forgetful reader knows more than the reader with a better memory. I suspect the same thing will happen in versions of Goldman's explosive inductive argument. Imagine a thinker observes all the $F$s within 3 miles, sees they are all $G$, and rationally infers that all the $F$s within 4 miles are $G$. Some time later they retain the belief, the knowledge actually, that all $F$s within 4 miles are $G$. But they forget that this was partially inferential knowledge, like Jaidyn forgot the source of his knowledge that $p$. They then make the seemingly sensible inductive inference that all $F$s within 5 miles are $G$. Is this rational, and can it produce knowledge? I think the answer is yes; if they (not unreasonably) forget the source of their knowledge that the $F$s 3 to 4 miles away are $G$, then this knowledge becomes basic. If it's basic, it is evidence. And if it is evidence, it can support one round of inductive reasoning. 

I've drifted a fair way from discussing interest-relativity. And a lot of what I say here is inessential to defending IRT. So I'll return to the main plotline with a discussion of how my view of evidence implies a rejection of a key principle in Jeremy Fantl and Matthew McGrath's theory of knowledge.

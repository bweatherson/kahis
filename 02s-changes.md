## A Million Dead End Streets {#changes}

As I've noted already, the view I'm defended here is somewhat different from my earlier view. And it's helpful too understand the view of this book to lay out, in one place, the ways in which time has changed my views. Here is a somewhat simplified version of the view from _Can We Do Without Pragmatic Encroachment_. Assume that S is interested in some quantitative questions and some alethic (i.e., yes/no) questions. Then the view was that S believes that $p$ if and only if these two conditions are met.

1. For any quantitative question _Q?_ that S is interested in, and any alethic question _A_ that S is interested in, S's answers to the question _If A, Q?_ and _If A and p, Q?_ are the same.
2. S's credence in $p$ is greater than 0.5.

It was assumed that S is always 'interested' in the null question _Is a tautology true?_, so one special instance of this is that S answers _Q?_ and _If p, Q?_ the same way. And it was assumed that S is an expected utility maximiser, so the practical question of what to do becomes just the quantitative question _Which of these options has the highest expected utility?_. There are bells and whistles, especially in thinking about the level of precision that goes along with the quantitative questions that S is interested in. (Draw these too fine, and S doesn't have beliefs, so you have to be a little careful here.) But this is enough to see the basic view, and to see its problems.

There is a lot about this view I've kept. There are still the two parts, one primarily to do with propositions that are not practically relevant, and one to do with propositions that are. And the clause to deal with propositions that are practically relevant requires close match between conditional and unconditional answers. 

But there are a lot of changes. Going from saying that the credence in $p$ is greater than 0.5 to saying that S is willing, at least sometimes, to take $p$ for granted, is a big change. I no longer presuppose that questions about what to do just are questions about expected utility. I've stopped focussing exclusively on answers to (conditional) questions, and moved to talking about both answers and ways that questions are answered. And I dropped the requirement that we look at these potentially quite abtruse questions, such as how to answer _Q?_ assuming both _A_ and $p$. The last two changes offset each other; the reason for including these doubly conditional questions was, in effect, to look at how S was willing to get to answers about questions with more practical import.

There are many reasons, most of them due to perceptive critics of my earlier work, for making these changes. I'll just focus here on the five that have been most significant.

## Global Interest Relativity {#global}

IRT  was introduced as a thesis about knowledge. I'm going to argue in chapter \@ref(ratbel) that it also extends to rational belief. Not every case where interests matter to knowledge generates a Dharmottara case. But we need not stop there. At the extreme, we could argue that every epistemologially interesting notion is interest-relative. Doing so gives us a global version of IRT. And that is what I'm going to defend here.

Jason @Stanley2005 comes close to defending a global version. He notes that if one has both IRT, and a 'knowledge first' epistemology Â [@Williamson2000], then one is a long way to towards global IRT. Even if one doesn't accept the whole knowledge first package, but just accepts the thesis that evidence is all and only what one knows, then one is a long way towards globalism. After all, if evidence is interest-relative, then probability, justification, rationality, and evidential support are interest-relative too.

That's close to the path I'll take to global IRT, but not exactly it. In chapter \@ref(evidence) I'm going to argue that evidence is indeed interest-relative, and so all those other notions are interest-relative too. But the version of IRT I'll put forward implies that evidence is a subset of knowledge.

There is a deep puzzle here for IRT that for a long time I couldn't see a way out of. On the one hand, the arguments for IRT look like they will generalise to arguments for the interest-relativity of evidence. (This is something Tom Donaldson convinced me of in conversations some years back.) On the other hand, the explanation I want to offer of cases like Anisa's presupposes that we can identify Anisa's evidence independent of her interests. I want to say that Anisa shouldn't play Blue-True because the evidential probability of the blue sentence being true is lower than the evidential probability of the red sentence being true. And she can't know the blue sentence is true because she can't play Blue-True. This turns into a nice story about when changes of interests lead to changes in belief if we can independently identify Anisa's evidence, and hence the evidential probability of different propositions. But the story looks much less nice if interests also affect evidence.

The aim of chapter \@ref(evidence) is to tell a story that avoids the worst of these problems. On the story I'll tell, evidence is indeed interest-relative. And that means we can't tell a simple story about precisely when changes in interests will lead to changes in knowledge. But it will still be true that people lose knowledge when the evidential probability of a proposition is no longer high enough for them to take it for granted with respect to every question they are interested in. And I will be able to say how interests impact evidence in a way that doesn't require antecedently identifying how interests impact knowledge, so the story will still be somewhat reductive. But it won't be as simple a story as I once believed in.

## Neutrality {#neutrality}

This book defends, at some length, the idea that knowledge is interest-relative. But I'm staying neutral on a number of other topics in the vicinity.

Most notably, I'm not taking any stand on whether _contextualist_ theories of knowledge are true or false. If you think that contextualism is true, then what I'm defending is that the view that 'knowledge' picks out in this context, and in most other contexts, is interest-relative.

Contextualist theories of knowledge have a lot in common with interest-relative theories. The kind of cases that motivate the interest-relative theories, cases like Anisa's and Blaise's, also motivate contextualism. They might even be seen as competitors, since they are offering rival explanations of similar phenomena. But they are not strictly inconsistent. Consider principles A and B below.

A.  A's utterance that _B knows that p_ is true only if for any question _Q?_ in which A is interested, the rational answer for B to give is the same unconditionally as it is conditional on $p$.
B.  A's utterance that _B knows that p_ is true only if for any question _Q?_ in which B is interested, the rational answer for B to give is the same unconditionally as it is conditional on $p$.

I endorse principle B, and that's why I endorse an interest-relative theory of knowledge. If I endorsed principle A, then I would be (more or less) committed to a contextualist theory of knowledge. And principle A is not inconsistent with principle B.^[There is a technical difficulty in how to understand one person answering an infinitival question that another person is asking themselves. But the points I'm making in this section aren't sensitive to this level of technical detail.]

It isn't hard to see why cases like Anisa and Blaise can move one to endorse principle A, and hence contextualism. It would be very odd for Anisa to say "This morning, I knew the Battle of Agincourt was in 1415." That's odd because she can't now take it as given that the Battle of Agincourt was in 1415, and in some sense she wasn't in any better or worse evidential position this morning with respect to the date of the battle. Perhaps, and this is the key point, it would even be false for Anisa to say this now. The contextualist, especially the contextualist who endorses principle A, has a good explanation for why that's false. The interest-relative theorist doesn't have anything to say about that. Personally I think it's not obvious whether this would be false for Anisa to say, or merely inappropriate, and even if it is false, there may be decent explanations of this that are not contextualist. But there is clearly an argument for contextualism here. And it isn't one that I'm going to endorse or reject.

As I've already noted, I'm making heavy use of the principle that Jessica Brown calls K-Suff. I'm going to defend that at much greater length in what follows. What I'm not defending is the converse of that principle, what she calls K-Nec.

K-Nec
:    An agent can properly use $p$ as a reason for action only if she knows that $p$.

The existing arguments for and against K-Nec are intricate and interesting, and I don't have anything useful to add to them. All I will note is that the argument of this book doesn't rely on K-Nec, and I'm just going to set it aside.

And I'm obviously not going to offer anything like a full theory of knowledge. I am defending a particular necessary condition on knowledge. That condition, plus some commonsensical claims about what we know in ordinary situations, entails that knowledge is interest-relative. And that's just about as far as I'll go.

I will be making one claim about how interests typically enter into the theory of knowledge. I'll argue that there is a certain kind of defeater. A person only knows that $p$ if the belief that $p$ coheres in the right way with the rest of their attitudes. What's 'the right way'? That, I argue, is interest-relative. In particular, some kinds of incoherence are compatible with knowledge if the incoherence concerns questions that are not interesting.

So the impact of interests is (typically) very indirect. Even if the other conditions for knowledge are satisifed, someone might fail to know something because it doesn't cohere well with the rest of their beliefs. But there is an exception to this exception clause. Incoherence with respect to uninteresting questions is compatible with knowledge.

This is going to matter because it affects how we think about what happen when interests change. It is odd to think that a change in interests could make one know something. But it isn't as odd to think that a change in interests could block or defeat something that was potentially going to block or defeat an otherwise well supported belief from being knowledge. This is something I will return to repeatedly in chapter \@ref(changesobjection).

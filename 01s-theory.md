## Theoretical Interests Matter {#whatinterests}

When saying why I called my theory IRT, one of the reasons I gave was that I wanted theoretical, and not just practical, interests to matter to knowledge.^[This section is based on §4 of my -@Weatherson2017-WEAII.] This is also something of a break with the existing literature. After all, Jason Stanley's book on interest-relative epistemology is called *Knowledge and Practical Interests*. And he defends a theory on which what an agent knows depends on the practical questions they face. But there are strong reasons to think that theoretical reasons matter as well.

In section \@ref(oddsandstakes), I suggested that someone knows that $p$ only if the rational choice to make would also be rational given $p$. That is, someone knows that $p$ only if the answer to the question _What should I do?_ is the same unconditionally as it is conditional on $p$. My preferred version of IRT generalises this approach. Someone knows that $p$ only if the rational answer to a question she is interested in is the same unconditionally as it is conditional on $p$. Interests matter because they determine just what it is for the person to be interested in a question. If that's how one thinks of IRT, the question of this section becomes, should we restrict questions the agent is interested in to just being questions about what choice to make? Or should they include questions that turn on her thoeretical interests, but which are irrelevant to choices before her? There are two primary motivations for allowing theoretical interests as well as practical interests to matter.

The first comes from the arguments for what Jeremy Fantl and Matthew McGrath call the Unity Thesis  [@FantlMcGrath2009 73--6]. They are interested in the thesis that whether or not $p$ is a reason for someone is independent of whether they are  engaged in practical or theoretical deliberation. But one doesn't have to be so invested in the ideology of reasons to appreciate their argument. Note that if only practical interests matter, then they know different things when considering the question _What to do in situation *S*_ in situation *S* and other situations. And if they know different things, those differential pieces of knowledge could lead to different answers. And that's very unintuitive. After all, they might be deliberating about this question because situation *S* might arise, and they want to be practically ready for it.

Let's make that a little less abstract. Imagine Anisa is not actually faced with the choice between Red-True, Blue-True, Red False and Blue-False with these particular red and blue sentences. In fact, she has no practical decision to make that turns on the date of the Battle of Agincourt. But she is idly musing over what she would do if she were playing that game. If she knows when the battle was, then she should be indifferent between Red-True and Blue-True. After all, she knows they will both win \$50. But intuitively she should think Red-True is preferable, even in the abstract setting. And this seems to be the totally general case.

The general lesson is that if whether one can take $p$ for granted is relevant to the choice between A and B, it is similarly relevant to the theoretical question of whether one would choose A or B, given a choice. And since those questions should receive the same answer, if $p$ can't be known while making the practical deliberation between A and B, it can't be known while musing on whether A or B is more choiceworthy.

There is a second reason for including theoretical interests in what's relevant to knowledge. There is something odd about the following reasoning: The probability of *p is precisely x*, therefore $p$, in any case where $x < 1$. It is a little hard to say, though, why this is problematic, since we often take ourselves to know things on what we would admit, if pushed, are purely probabilistic grounds. The version of IRT that includes theoretical interests allows for this. If we are consciously thinking about whether the probability of $p$ is *x*, then that's a relevant question to us. Conditional on $p$, the answer to that question is clearly no, since conditional on $p$, the probability of $p$ is 1. So anyone who is thinking about the precise probability of $p$, and not thinking it is 1, is not in a position to know $p$. And that's why it is wrong, when thinking about $p$'s probability, to infer $p$ from its high probability.

Putting the ideas so far together, we get the following picture of how interests matter. Someone knows that $p$ only if the evidential probability of $p$ is close enough to certainty for all the purposes that are relevant, given their theoretical and practical interests. Assuming the background theory of knowledge is non-sceptical, this will entail that interests matter.

## Maps and Legends {#mapslegends}

Beliefs, Frank Ramsey famously said, are maps by which we steer [@RamseyGeneralProp, 146]. I agree, and I think you can turn this into an argument that belief should be interest-relative as well. The end of the argument is a little tricky, and there is a rival position that I don't have a particularly strong objection to. But let's first see why the map based picture of belief naturally leads to interest-relativity.

When I was growing up in car-dependent, suburban Melbourne, the main street directory that was used was the Melways. This was a several hundred page thick book that most people kept a copy of in their car. It largely consisted of page after page of 1:20,000 scale maps of the Melbourne suburbs, plus more detailed maps of the inner city, and then progressively less detailed maps of the rural areas around Melbourne, the rest of Victoria, and finally of the rest of the country. And it was everywhere. It was common for store advertisements, party invitations and event announcements to include the Melways page and grid coordinates of the location. In fact I was a little shocked when I moved to America and I found it was socially expected (in those pre-Google Maps days)  that you would give people something like turn by turn directions to a location. I was used to just telling people where something was, i.e., giving them the  Melways grid coordinates, and letting them use the map to get themsleves there. The Melways really was, collectively, the map by which we steered.

But you wouldn't want to use it for everything. You wouldn't want to use it as a hiking map, for example. For one thing, it was much too heavy. For another, it was patchy on which walking trails it even included, and had almost no usable topographical information. You steer yourself by one map when you drive, and another map (or set of maps) when you hike. What one steers by is a function of one's interests. And the same, I think, is true of belief. Beliefs are interest relative because to believe something is to steer yourself by a map that represents the world as being that way, and which map one will steer by is sensitive to one's interests.

Maybe you think this argument leans too heavily on Ramsey's analogy of beliefs and maps. But once you see the structure of the case, you can get more purely cognitive examples. (And this in turns helps us see the brilliance of Ramsey's metaphor.) Think of the role that simple economic models play in our thought. For a lot of purposes, I'll use a simple supply-demand model to work out the effects of a change in market conditions. But if a lot rides on the matter, or if I'm trying to work out something that changes a lot of markets at once (such as a rise in the minimum wage), I won't take these models as anything more than vaguely indicative of the truth. When trying to steer through tricky economic waters, which models I steer by will be a function of what I'm interested in at the time. Still, let's not overstate this. If you ask me what effect a new tax on widgets will have, I'll conclude it will raise the price of widgets, but by slightly less than the amount of the tax, and decrease the quantity of widgets bought, and that the quantity of those changes will be a function of the slopes of the supply curve and demand curve for widgets. That conclusion is a belief, notwithstanding any hesitation I have about using that very model in more complicated cases. I believe what simple models say, but only when there are no practical or theoretical reasons to override the model.

So it looks like belief is interest-relative, and that's for deep reasons about the role that belief plays in our cognitive economy. But note that things get complicated when we stop focussing on what normal (or normal-ish) people do, and think about less common reactions. After all, a metaphysics of belief should have something to say about them too.

Consider a person, call them Stubbie, who uses the same maps and models for every task. They use the Melways for hiking, they make macro-economic forecasts using simple supply-demand models, and so on. And they do this even though they know full well that there are excellent reasons to be more flexible. What should we say about Stubbie?

I think we should say that Stubbie is irrationally stubborn, and part of his irrationality consists in steering by the same map, in holding onto the same beliefs, in situations where this is uncalled for. Stubbie really believes that a simple supply-demand model is predictive even in complicated cases. He's wrong, and his evidence shows that he is wrong, but our theory of belief had better allow for some false, irrational beliefs.

Stubbie's example shows that while one's beliefs should be interest-relative, they need not be. One should steer by a map suitable to the circumstances. But if one stubbornly steers by the same map come what may, the fact that it would be advisable to steer by different maps at different times does not affect what one believes. Stubbie really is steering himself by the Melways when hiking, and he really believes the simple economic model he uses. 

We have already seen another pair of cases that are like Stubbie in this respect - Anisa and Blaise. Both of them are irrational. And their irrationality consists in holding onto beliefs that they should abandon. But it is a mistake to say that because their interests have changed, that makes their beliefs change. What's true is that because their interests changed, their beliefs should have changed, but weirdly they did not. Interests change normative requirements; they don't on their own make one satisfy those changed requirements.

This refutes a position that I never explicitly adopted, but which I was I think implicitly committed to: that it is part of having beliefs that those beliefs are interest-relative. That isn't right. Some people are like Stubbie, and have interest-invariant beliefs. You shouldn't be like that; it's really irrational. But we can still take the intensional stance towards Stubbie.

There is a variant of Stubbie's case that raises particularly hard questions for my view. Imagine that Stubbie is disposed to keep taking the simple model for granted. But now he is faced with a decision where the simple model has to be exactly right for its predictions to be accurate, and the costs of being wrong are enormous. And further imagine that Stubbie sees all this, and the shock of having that much at stake causes him to reconsider. So he drops the simple supply-demand model.

This is not, I think, a case of interest-relativity of belief. Rather, it is like the kind of case Jennifer @Nagel2010 discusses, when she talks about beliefs being causally sensitive to interests. And this shows we have to be careful, more careful than I was in earlier work, to be sure that a case of interest-sensitivity is really a case where belief is constitutively, and not merely causally, sensitive to interests.

In cases of belief formation, it might be very hard to tease these two apart. Imagine that Blaise has a sister, Deja, who has read the same book about the Battle of Agincourt. And she is asked to bet on the proposition $p$, which is _That the Battle of Agincourt took place 374 years (to the nearest year) before the storming of the Bastille_. The odds are the same as in Blaise's case: a moment's joy for an infant if she's right; The Bad Place for all of us if she's wrong. She declines the bet, wisely thinking it isn't worth the risk. She is more certain that the Bastille was stormed in 1789 than she is that these are the terms of the bet, and she can subtract 1415 from 1789, so her declining is solely down to her worries about when the Battle of Agincourt was.

But note that while her beliefs before being offered the bet entailed that $p$ was true, she didn't actually believe it. She hadn't given any thought to this kind of comparative claim. She was disposed to believe it upon considering the matter, but that's not sufficient for actual belief. And, when faced with the proposition in precisely this context, she doesn't form the belief.

Here we get to a philosophical question that I have little idea how to answer. Deja doesn't believe $p$. And the explanation for this non-belief in part goes via her interests in keeping humanity out of The Bad Place. But is this a case where Deja's beliefs are causally, or constitutively, sensitive to her interests? I don't really know, and I don't really know how to motivate one view or another. If this was the only kind of case where interests mattered to beliefs, arguably the most plausible, and most conservative, way to treat the case would be to say that Deja's interests have a merely causal impact on her beliefs.

But this isn't the only kind of case to consider, and it isn't the one that I think is strongest for the view that interests can be constitutively relevant to beliefs. To see this, we need to add one last sibling to Blaise and Deja's family, their sister Eulalie. She has read the same book, and oddly last night she was also asked whether she wanted to bet on $p$. But in her case the odds were more favorable. Should she take the bet, then she would win €10 if $p$ is true, and lose €10 if it is false. She took the bet and (as best she can remember), won the bet.

Now Eulalie is offered the same bet that Deja is offered. She declines it, and she was always disposed to decline any such bet. She has no inclination whatsoever to risk the future of humanity on something she read in a history book. She doesn't believe $p$, and this non-belief is explained by her interests. Is this a case where interests are causally or constitutively relevant to belief? I think you can make a case either way, but the case for it being a constiutive connection is a little stronger.

Because not a lot turns on this, and because I'm not that sure myself what the right answer is, I'll just note a handful of facts about Eulalie's case. As I've described the case, the high stakes bet didn't have to trigger anything like anxiety in her. All that was required to have her lose the belief was an appreciation of the situation she faced, and the automatic activity of some cognitive processes. That sounds more like a case where interests are constitutively relevant than one where they cause something that blocks belief. Nagel's positive argument that interests normally matter because they cause something like anxiety that blocks belief largely focusses on cases like Deja, who is forming a belief, not on cases like Eulalie, who merely loses one. And, perhaps most importantly, it is easier to formulate a positive theory of belief, one that covers both tacit and explicit beliefs about relevant and irrelevant matters, if one takes Eulalie's example to be one where interests play a constitutuve role. I'll now turn to building just that theory.

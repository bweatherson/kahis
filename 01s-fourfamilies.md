## Four Families {#fourfamilies}

A lot of philosophers have written about cases like Anisa and Blaise over the last couple of decades. Relatedly, there are a huge number of theories that have been defended concerning these cases. Rather than describe them all, I'm going to start with a taxonomy of them. The taxonomy has some tricky edge cases, and it isn't always trivial to classify a philosopher from their statements about the cases. But I find it a helpful way to start thinking about the possible moves available.

Our first group of theories are the **sceptical** theories. They deny that Anisa ever knew that the Battle of Agincourt was in 1415. The particular kind of sceptic I have in mind says that if someone's epistemic position is, all things considered, better with respect to $q$ than with respect to $p$, that person doesn't know that $p$. The core idea for this sceptic, which perhaps they draw from work by Peter @Unger1975, is that knowledge is a maximal epistemic state, so any non-maximal state is not knowledge. The sceptics say that for almost any belief, Anisa's belief that two plus two is four will have higher epistemic standing than that belief, so that belief doesn't amount to knowledge.

Our second group of theories are what I'll call **epistemicist** theories. The epistemicists say that Anisa's reasoning, and perhaps Blaise's reasoning too, is perfectly sound. They both know when the Battle of Agincourt took place, so they both know that the choices they take are optimal, so they are rational in taking those choices. The intuitions to the contrary are, say the epistemicist, at best confused. There is something off about Anisa and Blaise, perhaps, but it isn't that these particular decisions are irrational.

It's not essential to epistemicism as I'm construing it, but I think by far the most plausible form of epistemicism takes on board Maria Lasonen-Aarnio's point that act-level and agent-level assessments might come apart.^[See Lasonen-Aarnio [-@Lasonen-Aarnio2010b; -@Lasonen-Aarnio2014] for more details on her view. In _Normative Externalism_, I describe the difference between act-level and agent-level assessments as the difference between asking whether what Anisa does is rational, and whether Anisa's action manifests wisdom [@Weatherson2019, 124-5]. The best form of epistemicism, I'm suggesting, says that Anisa and Blaise are rational but unwise. This isn't Lasonen-Aarnio's terminology, but otherwise I'm just coopting her ideas.] Taking the bet reveals something bad about Blaise's character, and arguably manifests a vice, but the act itself is rational. It's that last claim, that the actions are rational, that is distinctive of epistemicism as I'm understanding it.

The third group is the **pragmatist** theories, and this group includes the interest-relative theory that I'll defend. The pragmatists say that Anisa did know when the Battle of Agincourt was, but now she doesn't. The change in her practical situation, combined with her interest in getting more money, destroys her knowledge.

And the final group are what I'll call, a little tendentiously, the **orthodox** theories. Orthodoxy says that Anisa knew when the Battle of Agincourt was last night, since her belief satisfied every plausible criteria for testimonial knowledge. And it says she knows it today, since changing practical scenarios or interests like this doesn't affect knowledge. But it also says that the actions that Anisa and Blaise take are wrong; they are both irrational, and Blaise's is arguably immoral. And that is true because of how risky the actions are. So knowing that what you are doing is for the best is consistent with your action being faulted on epistemic grounds.

My reading of the literature is that a considerable majority of philosophers writing on these cases are orthodox. (Hence the name!) But I can't be entirely sure, because a lot of these philosophers are more vocal about opposing pragmatist views than they are about supporting any particular view. There are some views that are clearly orthodox in the sense I've described, and I really think most of the people who have opposed pragmatist treatments of these cases are orthodox, but it's possible more of them are sceptical or epistemicist than I've appreciated.

Calling this last group orthodox lets me conveniently label the other three groups as heterodox. And this lets me state what I hope to argue for in this book. I think that the interest-relative treatment of the cases is correct; and if it isn't, then at least some pragmatist treatment is correct; and if it isn't, then at least some heterodox treatment is correct. 

And it's worth laying out the interest-relative case in some detail, because we can only properly assess the options holistically. Every view is going to have some very counterintuitive consequences, and we can only weigh them up when we see them all laid out.

The last claim, that every view has counterintuitive consequences, deserves some defence. I'll say much more about the challenges orthodoxy faces in section \@ref(orthodox). But just to set out a simple version of the problems for each theory, observe all of the following look true.

* Sceptical theories imply that when Anisa is reading her book, she doesn't gain knowledge even though the book is reliable and she believes it because of a well-supported belief in its reliability.
* Epistemicist theories imply that Anisa and Blaise make rational choices, even though they take what look like absurd risks.
* Pragmatist theories say that offering someone a bet can cause them to lose knowledge and, presumably, that withdrawing that offer can cause them to get the knowledge back.
* Orthodox theories say that it is irrational to do something that one knows will get the best result simply because it might get a bad result.

Much of what follows in this book, like much of what's in this literature, will fall into one of two categories. Either it will be an attempt to sharpen one of these implausible consequences, so the view with that consequence looks even worse than it does now. Or it will be an attempt to dull one of them, by coming up with a version of the view that doesn't have quite as bad a consequence. Sometimes this latter task is sophistry in the bad sense; it's an attempt to make the implausible consequence of the theory harder to say, and so less of an apparent flaw on that ground alone. But sometimes it is valuable drawing of distinctions. (That is, scholasticism in the good sense.) It turns out that the alleged plausible claim is ambiguous; on one disambiguation we have really good reason to believe it is true, on another the theory in question violates it, but on no disambiguation do we get a violation of something really well-supported. I hope that they work I do here to defend the interest-relative theory is more scholastic than sophistic, but I'll leave that for others to decide.

Still, if all of the theories are implausible in one way or another, shouldn't we look for an alternative? Perhaps we should look, but we won't find any. At least if we define the theories carefully enough, the truth is guaranteed to be among them. Let's try placing theories by asking three yes/no questions.

1. Does the theory say that Anisa knew last night that the Battle of Agincourt was in 1415? If no, the theory is sceptical; if yes, go to question 2.
2. Does the theory say that Anisa is rational to play Blue-True? If yes, the theory is epistemicist; if no, go to question 3.
3. Does the theory say that Anisa still knows that the Battle of Agincourt was in 1415, at the time she chooses to play Blue-True? If no, the theory is pragmatist; if yes, the theory is orthodox.

That's it - those are your options. There are two two points of clarification that matter, but I don't think they make a huge difference.

The first point of clarification is really a reminder that these are families of views. It might be that one member of the family is considerably less implausible than other members. Indeed, I've changed my mind a fair bit about what is the best kind of pragmatist theory since I first started writing on this. And there are a lot of possible orthodox theories. Finding out the best version of these kinds of theories, especially the last two kinds, is hard work, but it is worth doing. But I very much doubt it will lessen the implausibility of the resulting theory; some of the implausibility flows directly from how one answers the three questions.

The second point of clarification is that what I've really done here is classify what the different theories say about Anisa's case. They may say different things about other cases. A theory might take an epistemicist stand on Anisa's case, but an orthodox one on Blaise's case, for example. Or it might be orthodox about Anisa, but would be epistemicist if the blue sentence was something much more secure, such as that the Battle of Hastings was in 1066. If this taxonomy is going to be complete, it needs to say something about theories that treat different cases differently. So here is the more general taxonomy I will use. 

The cases I'll quantify over have the following structure. The hero is given strong evidence for some truth $p$, and they believe it on the basis of that evidence. There are no defeaters, the belief is caused by the truth of the proposition in the right way, and in general all the conditions for knowledge that people worried about in the traditional (i.e., late twentieth century) epistemological literature are met. Then they are offered a choice, where one of the options will have an optimal outcome if $p$, but will not maximise expected value unless the probability of $p$ is absurdly close to 1. And while hero's evidence is strong, it isn't that strong. Despite this, hero takes the risky option, using the fact that $p$ as a key part of their reasoning. Now consider the following three questions.

1. In cases with this form, does the theory say that when the hero first forms the belief that $p$, they know that $p$? If the answer is that this is _generally_ the case, then restrict attention to those cases where they do know that $p$, and move to question 2. Otherwise, the theory is sceptical.
2. In the cases that remain, is hero rational in taking the option that is optimal if $p$, but requires very high probability to maximise expected returns? If the answer is yes in _every_ case, the theory is epistemicist. Otherwise, restrict attention to cases where this choice is irrational, and move to question 3.
3. In _any_ of the cases that remain, does the fact that hero was offered the choice destroy their knowledge that $p$? If yes, the theory is pragmatic. If no, the theory is orthodox.

So I'm taking epistemicism to be a very strong theory - it says that knowledge always suffices for action that is optimal given what's known, and that offers of bets never constitute a loss of knowledge. The epistemicist can allow that the offer of a bet may cause a person to 'lose their nerve', and hence their belief that $p$, and hence their knowledge that $p$. But if they remain confident in $p$, they retain knowledge that $p$.

And I'm taking pragmatism to be a very weak theory - it says sometimes the offer of a bet can constitute a loss of knowledge. The justification for defending such a weak theory is that so many philosophers are aghast at the idea that practical considerations like this could ever be relevant to knowledge. So even showing that the existential claim is true, that sometimes practical issues matter, would be a big deal.

And orthodoxy is a weak claim on one point, and a strong claim on another. It says there are some cases where knowledge does not suffice for action - though it might take these cases to be very rare. It is common in defences of orthodoxy to say that the cases are quite rare, and use this fact to explain away intuitions that threaten orthodoxy. But it says that pragmatic factors never matter - so it can be threatened by a single case like Anisa.

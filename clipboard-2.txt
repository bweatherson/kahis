In the 2005 paper, I argued that what we should say someone believed is something we reconstruct from their patterns of preferences. At a high level of generality, my theory was that you could look at the outputs of someone's deliberation, and construct from that what they believed. This was a quite radical version of radical interpretation. Following Weisberg, I now think that focussing on outputs in this way was mistaken.

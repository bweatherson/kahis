What questions are relevant to knowledge?

It can't be just that the thinker is interested in the question.

That is too easy, especially for long run questions like "The French Revolution, what was it about?"

The problems here are with what Danielle Dover (2023) calls fascination. Some people say there are not really questions, but they sound like questions to me. Jane Friedman might have changed her views on this, have to look it up.

The trick I think is that the thinker has to be **attending** to the question. I can think about the French Revolution for decades, but I can't attend to it for decades.

What is attention in this sense? Who tf knows. But I think that is the trick.

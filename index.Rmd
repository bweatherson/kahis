description: "A defence of an interest-relative theory of knowledge"
---

# Front Matter {-}

Draft of a book in progress defending interest-relative theories in epistemology. A few of the sections, and 3 of the chapters, are not done. But hopefully it is interesting enough to share.

The view is somewhat customisable using the toolbar above. You can change the font type, the font size, and the background color. I think it looks best with a sans serif font and a sepia background, but ymmv. You can also search the book.

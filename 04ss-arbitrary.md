### Arbitrariness {#lockearb}

The first problem for the Lockeans, and in a way the deepest, is that it makes the boundary between belief and non-belief arbitrary. This is a point that was well made some years ago now by Robert @Stalnaker1984 [91]. Unless these numbers are made salient by the environment, there is no special difference between believing $p$ to degree 0.9876 and believing it to degree 0.9875. But if $t$ is 0.98755, this will be *the difference* between believing $p$ and not believing it, which is an important difference. 

The usual response to this, as found in @Foley1993 [Ch. 4] and @Hunter1996 and @Lee2017b, is to say that the boundary is vague. Now we might respond to this by noting that this only helps on an implausible theory of vagueness. On epistemicist theories, or supervaluationist theories, or on my preferred comparative truth theory (@Weatherson2005b), there will still be an arbitrary point which marks the difference between belief and non-belief. This won't be the case on various kinds of degree of truth theories. But, as @Williamson1994 pointed out, those are theories on which contradictions end up being half-true. And if saving the Lockean theory requires that we give up on the idea that contradictions are simply false, it is hard to see how it is worth the price.

But a better response is to think about what it means to say that the belief/non-belief boundary is a vague point on a scale. We know plenty of terms where the boundary is a vague point on a scale. Comparative adjectives are typically like that. Whether a day is hot depends on whether it is above some vague point on a temperature scale, for example. But here's the thing about these vague terms - they don't enter into lawlike generalisations. (At least in a non-trivial way. Hot days are 24 hours long, and that's a law, but not one that hotness has a particular role in grounding.) The laws involve the scale; the most you can say using the vague term is some kind of generic. For instance, you can say that hot days are exhausting, or that electricity use is higher on hot days. But these are generics, and the interesting law-like claims will involve degrees of heat, not the hot/non-hot binary.

It's a fairly central presupposition of this book that belief is not like that. Belief plays a key role in all sorts of non-trivial lawlike generalisations. Folk psychology is full of such lawlike generalisations. We're doing social science here, so the laws in question are hardly exceptionless. But they are counterfactually resilient, and explanatorily deep, and not just generics that are best explained using the underlying scale.

Of course, the Lockean doesn't believe that these generalisations of folk psychology are anything more than generics, so this is a somewhat question-begging argument. But if you're not antecedently disposed to give up on folk psychology, or reduce it to the status of a bunch of helpful generics, it's worth seeing how striking the Lockean view here is. So consider a generalisation like the following.

* If someone wants an outcome O, and they believe that doing X is the only way to get O, and they believe that doing X will neither incur any costs that are large in comparison to how good O is, nor prevent them being able to do something that brings about some other outcome that is comparatively good, then they will do X.

This isn't a universal - some people are just practically irrational. But it's stronger than just a generic claim about high temperatures. Or so I say. But the Lockean does not say this; they say that this has widespread counterexamples, and when it is true, it is a relatively superficial truth whose explanatory force is entirely derived from deeper truths about credences.

The Lockean, for instance, thinks that someone in Blaise's situation satisfies all the antecedents and qualifications in the principle. They want the child to have a moment of happiness. They believe (i.e., have a very high credence that) taking the bet will bring about this outcome, will have no costs at all, and will not prevent them doing anything else. Yet they will not think that people in Blaise's situation will generally take the bet, or that it would be rational for them to take the bet, or that taking the bet is explained by these high credences.

That's what's bad about making the belief/non-belief distinction arbitrary. It means that generalisations about belief are going to be not particularly explanatory, and are going to have systematic (and highly rational) exceptions. We should expect more out of a theory of belief.

# Rational Belief {#ratbel}

This chapter discusses the role of rational belief in the version of IRT that I defend. It starts by noting that the theory allows for a new kind of Dharmottara case, where a rational, true belief is not actually knowledge. And I argue that it is a good thing it allows this, for once we see the kind of case in question, it is plausible that it is a Dharmottara case. Then offer two arguments, one of them due to Timothy Williamson and the other novel, for the conclusion that it is possible to have rational credence 1 in a proposition without fully believing it. This undermines two prominent theories of the relationship between credence and full belief: that full belief is credence one, and that full belief is credence above some interest-invariant threshold. I'm going to focus primarily on the versions of those views that say that rational full belief is a matter of having rational credences that meet some property. The arguments that credence one is sometimes insufficient for belief are already problems for those views, but they each have a number of independent problems. I'll end the chapter by noting how the view of rational belief that comes out of IRT is immune to those problems.

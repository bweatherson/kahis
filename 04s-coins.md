## Coin Puzzles {#lockecoin}

So rational belief is not identical to rationally having the dispositions that constitute belief. But nor is rational belief a matter of rational high credence. I'll offer two arguments for this, one in this section and one in the next.

The point of these two sections is as much metaphysical as it is normative. I'm interested in arguing against the 'Lockean' thesis that to believe $p$ just is to have a high credence in $p$. Normally, this threshold of high enough belief for credence is taken to be interest-invariant, so this is a rival to IRT. But there is some variation in the literature about whether the phrase _The Lockean Thesis_ refers to a metaphysical claim, belief is high credence, or a normative claim, rational belief is rational high credence. Since everyone who accepts the metaphysical claim also accepts the normative claim, and usually takes it to be a consequence of the metaphysical claim, arguing against the normative claim is a way of arguing against the metaphysical claim.

The first puzzle for this Lockean view comes from an argument that Timothy @Williamson2007 made about certain kinds of infinitary events. A fair coin is about to be tossed. It will be tossed repeatedly until it lands heads twice. The coin tosses will get faster and faster, so even if there is an infinite sequence of tosses, it will finish in a finite time. (This isn't physically realistic, but this need not detain us. All that will really matter for the example is that someone could believe this will happen, and that's physically possible.)

Consider the following three propositions

(A)  At least one of the coin tosses will land either heads or tails.
(B)  At least one of the coin tosses will land heads.
(C)  At least one of the coin tosses after the first toss will land heads.

So if the first coin toss lands heads, and the rest land tails, (B) is true and (C) is false.

Now consider a few versions of the Red-Blue game (perhaps played by someone who takes this to be a realistic scenario). In the first instance, the red sentence says that (B) is true, and the blue sentence says that (C) is true. In the second instance, the red sentence says that (A) is true, and the blue sentence says that (B) is true. In both cases, it seems that the unique rational play is Red-True. But it's really hard to explain this in a way consistent with the Lockean view.

Williamson argues that we have good reason to believe that the probability of all three sentences is 1. For (B) to be false requires (C) to be false, and for one more coin flip to land tails. So the probability that (B) is false is one-half the probability that (C) is false. But we also have good reason to believe that the probabilities of (B) and (C) are the same. In both cases, they are false if a countable infinity of coin flips lands tails. Assuming that the probability of some sequence having a property supervenes on the probabilities of individual events in that sequence (conditional, perhaps, on other events in the sequence), it follows that the probabilities of (B) and (C) are identical. And the only way for the probability that (B) is false to be half the probability that (C) is false, while (B) and (C) have the same probability, is for both of them to have probability 1. Since the probability of (A) is at least as high as the probability of (B) (since it is true whenever (B) is true, but not conversely), it follows that the probability of all three is 1.

But since betting on (A) weakly dominates betting on (B), and betting on (B) weakly dominates betting on (C), we shouldn't have the same attitudes towards bets on these three propositions. Given a choice between betting on (B) and betting on (C), we should prefer to bet on (B) since there is no way that could make us worse off, and some way it could make us better off. Given that choice, we should prefer to bet on (B) (i.e., play Red-True when (B) and (C) are expressed by the red and blue sentences), because it might be that (B) is true and (C) false.

Assume (something the Lockean may not wish to acknowledge) that to say something might be the case is to reject believing its negation. Then a rational person faced with these choices will not believe _Either (B) is false or (C) is true_; they will take its negation to be possible. But that proposition is at least as probable as (C), so it too has probability 1. So probability 1 does not suffice for belief.

This is a real problem for the Lockean - no probability suffices for belief, not even probability 1. It's also, of course, a problem for the view that belief is probability 1 that I discussed back in section \@ref(probone). The next section discusses another way in which these two views are problematic.

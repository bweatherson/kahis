@Weatherson2011-WEADIR is right about everything, but there is a lot still to be done, including the plan for this chapter.

## High-Low Examples

There is one other problem for argument from cases for IRI. Imagine that
after two checks of the paper, we tell Bojan that Ankita's paper is a
duplicate of hers, and she has checked her paper in just the same way he
has checked his. And we tell him that Ankita does not overly care
whether her paper is typo-free, but is confident that it is. We then ask
him, does Ankita know her paper is typo free? Many philosophers think
Bojan should answer "No" here. And that isn't something IRI can explain.
According to IRI, he should say, "I don't know." He can't say Ankita
does know, since he doesn't know their common paper has no typos. But
it's hard to see why he should deny knowledge. Keith @DeRose2009 [185]
thinks this case is particularly hard for IRI to explain, while Brian
@Kim2015 offers some possible explanations. This objection doesn't tell
against the claim that knowledge is interest-relative, but it does
threaten the invariantism. An interest-relative contextualist should say
that everyone should deny Bojan knows his paper is typo free, and Bojan
should deny Ankita knows her paper is typo-free. (This was from motivations part of survey)

## Stability

1. Using intellectual interests removes a lot of the problem
2. We should just live with it. We need to explain why we insure against problems and plan as if those problems won't be relevant. And we don't plan as if "likely not relevant"; that's too hard. (Compare Davey on idealisations.)

### Hard Times and Close Calls {#meties}

In my earlier theory, any practical deliberation was modelled as an inquiry into which option had the highest expected utility. This was wrong for a number of reasons, not least that it gives implausible results in cases involving choices between very similar options. I'll briefly describe one example that illustrates the problem, and the start of how I plan to solve it. But it turns out to be rather tricky to get the details right, and I'll come back to this in subsection \@ref(andelim) and again in chapter \@ref(ties). The details of the example are new, but it's a very minor modification of a kind of example that is discussed in @McGrathKim2019 and credited to a talk by John Hawthorne "circa 2007". Similar examples are also discussed by Alex @Zweber2016 and by @AndersonHawthorne2019b, and I'm drawing on their insights in describing this one.

David is doing the weekly groceries. He needs a can of chickpeas, so he walks to where the chickpeas are and looks at the shelf. There are two cans, call them $c_1$ and $c_2$, that are equally easy to reach and get from the shelf. Call the actions of taking them $t_1$ and $t_2$. David simply assumes, partially on inductive grounds and partially on grounds of what he knows about supermarkets, that neither can has passed its expiry date. But while it is wildly implausible that either can has, the probability is not zero. Let $e_i$ be that can $i$ has expired, and assume that $\Pr(e_1)$ and $\Pr(e_2)$ are low and equal. Call this probability $e$. Let $h$ be the utility of choosing an unexpired can, and $l$ the utility of choosing an expired can, where obviously $h > l$. Then both $t_1$ and $t_2$ have utility $(1-e)h + el$. Conditional on $\neg e_1$, the utility of $t_1$ is $h$, which is greater than $(1-e)h + el$ as long as $e > 0$ and $h > l$. So unconditionally, $t_1$ and $t_2$ have the same utility, but conditional on $\neg e_1$, they have different utilities. So, according to the theory I used to defend, when David is making this choice, he does not believe, and hence does not know $\neg e_1$. This seems wrong, and there are even worse consequences one can draw my thinking about minor variants of the case.

The key part of my response to this will be distinguishing between the questions _Which can to choose?_, and the question _Which choice of can has maximal expected utility?_. If David is thinking about the latter question, then it turns out he really doesn't know $\neg e_1$. That's a somewhat surprising result, and I'll turn to defending it in chapter \@ref(ties). But as long as he is focussing solely on the former question, the argument of the previous paragraph doesn't go through.

So the big move here is to move from somewhat quantitative questions, like _Which choice maximises expected utility?_, to practical questions like _What to do?_. Once we do that, the problem that Zweber, and Anderson and Hawthorne, raise ceases to be a problem. I don't intend these brief remarks to be a convincing case that I've got a good solution to these problems. Rather, the point is to flag that the theory I'm defending here is distinct from the theory I used to defend, and this gives me some more resources to handle cases like David and the chickpeas.

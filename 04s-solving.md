## Solving the Challenges {#solving}

It's not fair to criticise other theories for their inability to meet a challenge that one's own theory cannot meet. So I'll end this chapter by noting that the six problems I've raised so far for Lockeans are not problems for my interest-relative theory of (rational) belief. I've already discussed the points about correctness in subsection \@ref(mecorrect), and about closure in chapter \@ref(knowledge), and there isn't much to be added. But it's worth saying a few words about the other four problems.

### Coins

I say that a necessary condition of believing that $p$ is a disposition to take $p$ for granted. The rational person will prefer betting on logically weaker rather than logically stronger propositions in the coin case, so they will not take the logically stronger ones for granted. If they did take them for granted, they would be indifferent between the bets. So they will not believe that one of the coin flips after the second will land heads, or even that one of the coin flips after the first will land heads. And that's the right result. The rational person should assign those propositions probability one, but not believe them.

### Games

In the up-down game, if the rational person believed that the other player would play up, they would be indifferent between up and down. But it's irrational to be indifferent between those options, so they wouldn't have the belief. They will think the probability that the other person will play up is one - what else could it be? But they will not believe it on pain of incoherence.

### Arbitrariness

According to IRT, the difference between belief and non-belief is the difference between willingness and unwillingness to take something as given in inquiry. This is far from an arbitrary difference. And it is a difference that supports law-like generalisations. If someone believes that $p$, and believes that given $p$, $A$ is better than $B$, they will prefer $A$ to $B$. This isn't a universal truth; people make mistakes. But nor is it merely a statistical generalisation. Counterexamples are things to be explained, while instances are explained by the underlying pattern.

### Moore

In many ways the guiding aim of this project was to avoid this kind of Moore paradoxicality. So it shouldn't be a surprise that we avoid it here. If someone shouldn't do something because $p$ might be false, that's conclusive evidence that they don't know that $p$. And it's conclusive evidence that either they don't rationally believe $p$, or they are making some very serious mistake in their reasoning. And in the latter case, the reason they are making a mistake is not that $p$ might be false, but that they have a seriously mistaken belief about the kind of choice they are facing. So we can never say that someone knows, or rationally believes, $p$, but their choice is irrational because $p$ might be false.
